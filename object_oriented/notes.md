# encapsulation --> 
Objects provide an interface to other code that wants to use them but maintain their own internal state. The object's internal state is kept private, meaning that it can only be accessed by the object's own methods, not from other objects. Keeping an object's internal state private, and generally making a clear division between its public interface and its private internal state, is called encapsulation.

# INHERITENCE
it allows classes to inherit properties and behabiours from other classes,forming a hierarchy of classes . Inherited features can be extended or overridden in derived classes

# polymorphism
In programming, polymorphism is a term used to describe a code or program that can handle many types of data by returning a response or result based on the given data.

For example, you have a form that is used to add products to a product catalog and three different types of products. With polymorphism, you can create a single class method to format all kinds of products before adding them to the database.

Polymorphism helps you eliminate complex and unnecessary if and switch statements, as they can become lengthy when writing complex programs.

Let's look at JavaScript objects in the next section.

# Abstraction
Abstraction in OOP is the process of exposing only the necessary functions to the user while hiding the complex inner workings to make the programs easier to use and understand.

For example, when you send a message on your phone, all the functions and logic that routes your message to the other person are hidden because you don't need to know them or how they work.

Similarly, in programming, if you are building an API that helps financial apps verify users identity and banking information, the developers that use your API don't need to know which database system you use or how you make calls to your database. All they need to know is the function they need to call and what parameters they need to provide.
