This line of code is related to the HTML <input> element, which is an element that allows the user to select one or more files from their device. For example, the following HTML code creates a file input that allows the user to select multiple image files:

```html
<input id="fileInput" type="file" accept="image/*" multiple>
```

The files property of this element returns a FileList object that contains the selected files. A FileList object is an array-like object that represents a collection of File objects. A File object is an object that represents a file on the user's device, and has properties such as name, size, type, and lastModified. For example, if the user selects two image files named "cat.jpg" and "dog.png", the files property of this element will return a FileList object like this:

```javascript
FileList {
  0: File {
    name: "cat.jpg",
    size: 123456,
    type: "image/jpeg",
    lastModified: 1628160000000,
    // ...
  },
  1: File {
    name: "dog.png",
    size: 234567,
    type: "image/png",
    lastModified: 1628250000000,
    // ...
  },
  length: 2
}
```

You can access the FileList object by using the files property of the input element. For example, you can use the following JavaScript code to get a reference to the input element and log its files property to the console:

```javascript
let input = document.getElementById("fileInput"); // get the input element by its id
console.log(input.files); // log its files property
```

You can also access the individual File objects in the FileList object by using their index or by using a loop. For example, you can use the following JavaScript code to log the name and size of each file in the FileList object:

```javascript
let fileList = input.files; // get the FileList object
for (let i = 0; i < fileList.length; i++) { // loop through each index
  let file = fileList[i]; // get the File object at that index
  console.log(file.name, file.size); // log its name and size
}
```

Alternatively, you can use a for...of loop to iterate over the File objects directly:

```javascript
for (let file of fileList) { // loop through each File object
  console.log(file.name, file.size); // log its name and size
}
```
# you mean the in the input-file the files comes in the form of object and then URL.crateObjectURL()uses that to crate an url
 Yes, that is correct. The input-file element has a files property that returns a FileList object, which contains the files that the user selects or drops. The URL.createObjectURL() method takes a File object as an argument and returns a URL that represents the file. This URL can be used to display the file on the web page. ðŸ˜Š
